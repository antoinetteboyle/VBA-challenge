Created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
  * The ticker symbol.
  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  * The total stock volume of the stock.
  * Includes conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
  * Returns the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume"
  * By the click of a macro-enabled button this VBA script runs on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
